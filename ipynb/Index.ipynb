This allows users to rapidly determine how a new method performs, relative to the precomputed results. Additionally, users can submit their taxonomic assignment method results to the [short-read-tax-assignment repository](https://github.com/gregcaporaso/short-read-tax-assignment/) as a pull request so they can be included as precomputed results for future users."

    "Given a set of precomputed taxonomic assignment method evaluation results (this will likely be the ones included in the [tax-credit GitHub repository](https://github.com/gregcaporaso/short-read-tax-assignment/)) and optionally a set of results generated by the user, the results generated by the user can be analyzed in the context of the precomputed results. This allows users to rapidly determine how a new method performs, relative to the precomputed results. Additionally, users can submit their taxonomic assignment method results to the [tax-credit repository](https://github.com/gregcaporaso/short-read-tax-assignment/) as a pull request so they can be included as precomputed results for future users.\n"

    "To prepare results from another classifier for analysis, you'll need to have [BIOM](http://www.biom-format.org) files with taxonomy assignments as an observation metadata category called ``taxonomy``. An example of how to generate these is presented in the [data generation notebook](./0-generate-tax-assignments.ipynb) in this directory, which was used to generated the precomputed data in the [short-read-tax-assignment repository](https://github.com/gregcaporaso/short-read-tax-assignment/).\n",

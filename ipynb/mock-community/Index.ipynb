This allows users to rapidly determine how a new method performs, relative to the precomputed results. Users can submit their taxonomic assignment methods results to the [short-read-tax-assignment GitHub repository](https://github.com/gregcaporaso/short-read-tax-assignment/) so they can be included as precomputed results for future users."

      "Mock community evaluations\n",
      "==========================\n",
      "\n",
      "This [IPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) describes how to apply the mock community evaluations  in (Bokulich, Rideout, et al. (in preparation)) to reproduce the analyses presented in that paper, or to extend them to other data sets. \n",
      "\n",
      "Given a set of precomputed taxonomic assignment method evaluation results (this will likely be the ones included in the [short-read-tax-assignment GitHub repository](https://github.com/gregcaporaso/short-read-tax-assignment/)) and optionally a set of results generated by the user, the results generated by the user can be analyzed in the context of the precomputed results. This allows users to rapidly determine how a new method performs, relative to the precomputed results. Users can submit their taxonomic assignment methods results to the [short-read-tax-assignment GitHub repository](https://github.com/gregcaporaso/short-read-tax-assignment/) so they can be included as precomputed results for future users.\n",
      "\n",
      "Requirements\n",
      "------------\n",
      "\n",
      "To run this notebook, you'll need to have the [short-read-tax-assignment GitHub repository](https://github.com/gregcaporaso/short-read-tax-assignment/). See the project's [README](https://github.com/gregcaporaso/short-read-tax-assignment/blob/master/README.md) for instructions. \n",
      "\n",
      "Structuring query results for comparison to subject results\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "To prepare results from another classifier for analysis, you'll need to have [BIOM](http://www.biom-format.org) files with taxonomy assignments as an observation metadata category called ``taxonomy``. An example of how to generate these is presented in the [usearch-tax-assigner notebook](./0-generate-tax-assignments.ipynb)).\n",
      "\n",
      "Your BIOM tables should be called ``table.biom``, and nested in the following directory structure:\n",
      "\n",
      "```\n",
      "results_dir/\n",
      " mock-community/\n",
      "  dataset-id/ \n",
      "   reference-db-id/\n",
      "    method-id/\n",
      "     parameter-combination-id/\n",
      "      table.biom\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "``results_dir`` is the name of the top level directory, and you will set this value in the first code cell of the analysis notebooks. You can name this directory whatever you want to. ``mock-community`` describes the specific analysis that is being run, and must be named ``mock-community`` for the framework to find your results.\n",
      "\n",
      "This directory structure is identical to that for the [precomputed results](https://github.com/gregcaporaso/short-read-tax-assignment/tree/master/data/subject-results). You can review that directory structure for an example of how this should look."

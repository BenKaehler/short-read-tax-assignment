# An extensible framework for optimizing classification enhances marker-gene taxonomic assignments: Supplementary Notebooks
These notebooks were used to perform the analyses presented in (Bokulich et al. (in preparation)), and can be used to reproduce the analyses in that paper, or to extend them to other data sets.

To run any of the analysis notebooks, you'll need the short-read-tax-assignment project. See the [README](../README.md) for installation instructions. For a static version of these notebooks that you can view as a webpage without installing anything, you can view the notebooks on nbviewer.

Questions should be posted as issues on the tax-credit repository issue tracker

## Extending the analyses to include evaluation of new taxonomic assignment methods
Given a set of precomputed taxonomic assignment method evaluation results (this will likely be the ones included in the short-read-tax-assignment GitHub repository) and optionally a set of results generated by the user, the results generated by the user can be analyzed in the context of the precomputed results. This allows users to rapidly determine how a new method performs, relative to the precomputed results. Additionally, users can submit their taxonomic assignment method results to the short-read-tax-assignment repository as a pull request so they can be included as precomputed results for future users.

An example of how to do this is included in our evaluation of the mothur implementation of the RDP Classifier:
